	<h1>Travel, the world is your playhouse!</h1>
		<p>Why think so small when the world is so big. The <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/anniedaly/peace-out-america?bffbcommunity&utm_term=.tcreZ02G9#.nmnQg6w1P">adventure</a> begins with you.</p>
		<p>The adventure link provides you 23 countries that are affordable when you are on a budget. Each country is given a brief description of what areas of the trip is cheap, either the flight ticket or the expenses as in food, lodging, etc. is cheaper. This is a good link to help guide you and gives you somewhat of an idea of how much you might spend on your trip. The downside of the link is that it doesn't mention when it's best to travel to those countries, you have to do your own research :)</p>	
	<h2><em>Travel quotes:</em></h2>
		<p>"Spontaneity is the best kind of adventure"</p>
		<p>"Fill your life with adventures, not things. Have stories to tell not stuff to show."</p>
		<p>"We travel not to escape life, but for life not to escape us."</p>
